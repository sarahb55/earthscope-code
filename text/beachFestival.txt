Minerva Pollywod of the beach beautification society would like to organize a beach festival this week. She is requesting your support and $5,000 from the town treasury to pay for security and cleanup for the festival. If you say no to her the town treasury will stay in tact but your popularity will decline. If you say yes the town treasury will go down but your popularity with the town citizens will increase. 

Can she count on your support?
