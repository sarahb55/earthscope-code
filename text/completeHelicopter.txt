Welcome to Volcano Island Mayor:

Great job installing the instruments. The two screens in your office show the up-to-minute data gathered. Use this information to determine if there is any danger to the town. 

Your job is to keep the people in your town safe. You might have to evacuate the island, but first, people need a warning.  Wait too long, and people won’t be ready. Warn too soon, and people won’t listen.
 
The Mayor’s Handbook can help you learn how to predict eruptions using scientific instruments that monitor the volcano. Good luck!
