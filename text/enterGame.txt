Welcome to Volcano Island Mayor:

You've just been elected the mayor of a small town near an active volcano. Please make yourself at home in your new office. You can see our wonderful volcano out of your window. 

The townspeople are worried about the volcano becoming active and erupting. 

The town council has authorized installing three GPS receivers and three seismometers on the volcano and a seismometer and GPS receiver away from the volcano. These instruments will measure any volcano activity and help to predict if and when the volcano will erupt. 

Luckily, you can pilot a helicopter. So, please drop off the receivers at the targets.

Thanks much,

Town Council
